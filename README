VIM-PLUGINS
===========

These are a collection of useful vim plugins I have created.
Currently:
html tag completion: Adds end tags for tags you write
<a href="link"
Then you type '>'
You have
<a href="link"></a>

list functions: Lists all the functions in the file
<C-f> lists the functions in files of type
vim, java, processing, C, C++, and python so far. More can easily be added in the GetKeywords function
Enter the function you want to jump to
